## FraHMMER

FraHMMER builds protein profile hidden Markov models (pHMMs)  and searches them against DNA sequence databases for translated  homologies.  By converting the protein pHMMs to frameshift aware  codon pHMMs, FraHMMER's search tool (frahmmsearch) can detect and align these translated homologies even in the presence of frameshift errors.

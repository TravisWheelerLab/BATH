## FraHMMER

FraHMMER (pronounced 'framer') uses profile hidden Markov models (pHMMs) to find translated homologies between protiens and DNA sequences. By converting protein pHMMs to frameshift aware codon pHMMs, FraHMMER's search tool (frahmmer) can detect and align these translated homologies even in the presence of frameshift errors.

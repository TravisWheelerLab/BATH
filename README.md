## BATH - Better Alignments with Translated HMMER

Are you tired of searching your genomes over and over but never getting out all those pesky proteins? Well, fret no more. Just give your genome a BATH!
BATH uses the latest in profile hidden Markov models (pHMMs) to find translated homologies between proteins and DNA sequences. Our open-source frameshift-aware translated algorithms, annotate even the toughest-to-find pseudogenes and other frameshifted coding regions. For just no easy payments of free 99 you too can annotate to your heart's content. Don't wait, download now!
